# Deployment

## Web FTP target

- Host: `ftp.connectio.com.au`
- Port: `21`
- Username: `opencode_upload@connectio.com.au`
- Password: stored in macOS Keychain as generic password service `dreamflowCommandForFlutterFlow.ftp`.

Retrieve password for agent-driven deployment:

```bash
security find-generic-password -s dreamflowCommandForFlutterFlow.ftp -a opencode_upload@connectio.com.au -w
```

Build and upload `dist/`:

```bash
npm run build
python3 scripts/deploy_ftp.py
```

If no deploy script exists, upload every file under `dist/` to the FTP account root, preserving subdirectories.
